# PR Tracker

This project is mainly to stop forgetting about assigned Pull Requests on Azure DevOps (currently, could be implemented for Github in the future)

The initial idea is for me to open my dev environment (currently just kitty with fish), and see if I have any assigned PRs


## Example

```
--- PR TRACKER ---

project-a:
    pr-title1
    pr-title2

project-b:
    pr-title1
    pr-title2


$ _
```
